NestedModels
============

This is a backport of the Rails 2.3 nested models functionality. This particular iteration of the nested models feature comes from the Rails 2.3RC1 release. Hopefully, this is added in such a way such that when updating to a new version of Rails, we will just have to remove this plugin and nothing will have to change in the models that define accept_nested_attributes_for().

TODO: Remove this plugin after updating to Rails >= v2.3!

Updated the plugin to include all the ActionView goodness for using nested forms as well as a copious amount of documentation throughout.
